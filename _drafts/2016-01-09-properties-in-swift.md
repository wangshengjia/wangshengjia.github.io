For years as a developer who using Obj-C every day, we are so familiar with the code below to define a property.

Usually I‚Äôd like to suggest to the beginner to always define a property in this way by default (Well.. in recent days, we may also take care a about nullability annotation). Because this is the best practise for most cases, there is no reason to use another approach with ‚Äúmodern‚Äù Xcode, such as iVar with synthesized keyword.

Now with Swift, things are all changed. We totally say goodbye to instance variable. Instead, we now have so many different ways to create and initialise a property. In this blog post, I‚Äôd like to walkthrough all the interesting cases about all type of property in Swift. You may use this post as a mini-cheatsheet if you want.

__As always, you can checkout the whole Gist from Github.__

__OK, let‚Äôs begin. Enjoy and have fun üçªüéâüéâ__

## A little preparation
Before all, let‚Äôs do some preparations first. In order to view clearly how are the properties initialised differently, we make a `Property` type which `print` the value in it‚Äôs init() method.

```swift
class Property {
    let content: String
    init(_ newContent: String) {
        content = newContent
        print("\(self.content)", terminator: ", ")
    }
}

class PropertyCheatSheet { }
```

## I. Stored property
- It can be either initialized in `init()`, in this case it require an explicit type.
- Or it can be set with a value directly, then let the compiler infer the right type.
- Stored property can also be inited in a `lazy` way, which means property4 will be inited only at the first time be accessed

```swift
var property1: Property // mutable property with Property type
let property2: Property // immutable property with Property type

// Property("3") will be called immediatelly, even before property1 & property2 be initialized
let property3 = Property("3")
// A lazy property can only be mutable.
lazy var property4 = Property("4")

init() {
    // need to be set a value in initializer
    property1 = Property("1")
    // even with an immutable property, you still need to set a value for once in initializer
    property2 = Property("2")
}

PropertyCheatSheet()
cheatsheet.property4
// => 3, 1, 2, 4,
```

A stored property can also be inited with a closure value. The syntax is a little bit similar as a `computed property` in some cases, but they have totally different behaviours. We'll walkthrough it later.

```swift
// Stored property with closure default value
var property5: Property = {
    return Property("5")
}()
// Computed property
var property5: Property {
    return Property("5")
}
```

As a stored property with a closure default value:

- Closure will be executed only once at the very beginning.
- It can be immutable, not as `Computed property`.
- We can not access `self` inside closure. Quite make sense since the moment closure executed there is even no `self`.
- It can also be `lazy`, of course in this case it need to be mutable. As return, we can access `self` in the closure.
- Be careful, if you try to access property itself in its own closure, you'll get a infinit loop üòú

```swift
...
let property5 = {
    // print(self) -> compile error
    return Property("5")
}()

lazy var property6: Property = {
    // print(self.property1) -> this is OK
    // print(self.property6) -> infinit loop
    return Property("6")
}()
...
var cheatsheet = PropertyCheatSheet()
cheatsheet.property4
cheatsheet.property6
// => 3, 5, 1, 2, 4, 6,
```

## II. Computed properties
As the name, `computed property` is kind of property you want to re-compute the value based on the context every time you access it, or set other properties and values indirectly.

- Computed property must have an explicit type.
- Computed property is kind of `lazy`, so it can only use `var` keyword. But it do not means you can actually `assign` the property.
- The `get` block of computed property will be executed every time property be accessed
- Without `set` block, the property is `read-only`
- We can access `self` inside since it is kind of `lazy`. Same as an stored property with closure, if you try to access property itself, then you'll get an infinit loop.

```swift
var property7: Property {
  // get {
    // print(self.property7) -> infinit loop
    return Property("7")
  // }
}
```

- If there is a setter, we must give also a getter.
- `newValue` as the default shorthand, can be changed with ohter custom value name.
- Should also be careful with the infinit loop issue.

```swift
// 1. If there is a setter, we must have a getter
// 2. "newValue" as default shorthand, can be changed with set(/* customValueName */) {}
var property8: Property {
    get {
        return Property(property1.content)
    }
    set {
        // self.property8 = Property("8") -> infinit loop
        property1 = Property(property1.content + "_" + newValue.content)
    }
}
```

## III. Property observing
